## Hello there. Welcome to my website. <span style="font-size: 0.5em;"> (Last Updated October  29, 2024.)</span>

A little bit about myself:
- I'm a recent Master's graduate from the University of Oxford. I did research with the Oxford Applied Theoretical Machine Learning Group ([OATML](https://oatml.cs.ox.ac.uk/)), supervised by [Yarin Gal](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/yarin.gal/website/). My thesis, ["Fine-Tuning Large Language Models to Abstain Appropriately via Semantic Entropy"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17234) was recently accepted to _NeurIPS Safe Generative AI Workshop 2024_.
- During my time at Oxford, I additionally performed research on temporal graph learning, supervised by [Michael Bronstein](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=UU3N6-UAAAAJ&hl=en). Our work ["Enhancing the Expressivity of Temporal Graph Networks via Source-Target Identification"](https://neurips.cc/virtual/2024/101413) was accepted to _NeurIPS Symmetry and Geometry in Neural Representations Workshop 2024_. 
- Prior to Oxford, I did my Bachelor's at the University of Cambridge, where I was the **valedictorian** of my cohort. 
- Other than machine learning, I have extensive experience (4 years) in software engineering, having spent time at [XTX Markets](https://www.xtxmarkets.com/) and [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/). 
- I'm currently actively looking for research positions to grow my research career.
